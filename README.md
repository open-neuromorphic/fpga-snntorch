# ISFPGA: Who needs neuromorphic hardware? Deploying SNNs to FPGAs via HLS

This repository contains the notebooks related to hardware-aware training of spiking neural networks presented and their deployment onto FPGAs at ISFPGA 2024 (Monterey, CA) for the workshop *Who needs neuromorphic hardware? Deploying SNNs to FPGAs via HLS* co-presented by Jason Eshraghian and Fabrizio Ottati.

There are two tutorial components in this repo:

* One for hardware-aware training spiking neural networks using [snnTorch](https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch)
* One for running several neuromorphic designs through the OpenLane flow using the Sky130 PDK
